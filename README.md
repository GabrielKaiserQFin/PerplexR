## Requirements

If you have a Pro subscription, you can create an API key by accessing
[Perplexity API page](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api), otherwise
you can not use `{perplexR}`.

To use your API key in `{perplexR}`, you need to configure it in the
.Renviron file, by executing `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add-insg the
following line:

``` r
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Otherwise you can also do this on a session-by-session basis by
performing the following step:

``` r
Sys.setenv(PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = "XX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
```

## Examples

### add-ins:

In your RStudio go to **add-ins** and select **ASK Large Language Model**, which will open
an interactive prompt in your Viewer, where you can choose between
different Large Language Models and adjust the temperature and the number of tokens to be
used. Just ask anything of you interest and hit the confirm button. The
**Done** button let you close the App. Similarly, you can mark or copy
any text or code and use the other add-ins as described below. add-ins
shortcuts will improve your efficiency even further.

### AskMe:

This is a basic example which shows you how to ask any question.

``` r
AskMe("What do you think about Large language models?")
[1] "Large language models, such as transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing in recent years. These models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language understanding tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text classification.\n\nOne of the key advantages of large language models is their ability to capture context and nuance in language. By training on vast amounts of text data, these models can learn to recognize patterns and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences that were previously unknown or difficult to capture using traditional rule-based approaches. This allows them to generalize well to new, unseen data and to perform well on a wide range of tasks.\n\nHowever, large language models also have some limitations. For example, they can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data and computational resources to train. They can also be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand why a particular decision was made. Additionally, large language models can be sensitive to the quality and biases of the training data, which can impact their performance and fairness.\n\nOverall, large language models have greatly advanced the field of natural language processing,"
[2] "Yes, I understand. However, it's important to note that the use of large language models for language translation is still a developing field, and there are many challenges and limitations that need to be addressed.\n\nOne of the main challenges is the need for large amounts of high-quality training data, which can be difficult to obtain for certain languages or domains. Additionally, large language models are computationally expensive and require significant resources to train, which can be a barrier for many organizations.\n\nAnother challenge is the potential for bias in the training data, which can result in biased or offensive outputs. This is a concern because language models are increasingly being used in critical applications, such as language translation for social media or business communication.\n\nDespite these challenges, the use of large language models for language translation holds great promise for improving the accuracy and efficiency of language translation systems. As the field continues to evolve, it will be important to address these challenges and develop new techniques and approaches for training and deploying large language models in a responsible and ethical manner."                                                                                                                                                                                              
```

### rewriteText:

This is a basic example which shows you how to rewrite text.

```

### translateText:

This is a basic example which shows you how to translate text.

``` r
translateText("Dear Recipient, I hope this message finds you well.", toLanguage = "Spanish")
[1] "\"Estimado(a) destinatario(a), espero que este mensaje te encuentre bien.\""
```

### annotateCode:

This is a basic example which shows you how to annotate code.

``` r
annotateCode("z <- function(x) scale(x)^2")
[1] "Sure! Here's the code with short inline comments added:\n\nz <- function(x) scale(x)^2 # Define a function z that takes a vector x as input\n# Apply the scale function to x and square the result\n# Return the squared scaled vector\n\nNote: The `#` symbol is used to indicate a comment in R, which means the code on that line will not be executed."
```

### buildUnitTests:

This is a basic example which shows you how to build Unit Tests for your
function.

``` r
buildUnitTests("z <- function(x) scale(x)^2")
[1] "Sure, here's an example of a `testthat` file with test cases for the given R code:\n```\n# load the testthat package\nlibrary(testthat)\n\n# create a test function for the z function\ntest_z <- function(x) {\n  # create a scaled version of x\n  x_sc <- scale(x)\n  # create the squared scaled version of x\n  x_sc2 <- x_sc^2\n  \n  # test that the squared scaled version of x is identical to the original x\n  expect_identical(x_sc2, x)\n}\n\n# run the test function for a few examples\ntest_z(1:2)\ntest_z(0:1)\ntest_z(c(1, 2, 3))\n```\nIn this example, we define a test function `test_z` that takes a vector `x` as input and tests whether the squared scaled version of `x` is identical to the original `x`. We then run the test function for a few examples, passing in different vectors as input.\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to test the given R code"
[2] "Sure! Here's the rest of the information:\n\n1. **Function Name**: The function name is \"z\".\n2. **Input Parameters**: The input parameters are \"x\" and \"y\".\n3. **Output**: The output is a vector that contains all the numbers from \"x\" to \"y\", minus the numbers that are divisible by 3.\n4. **Description**: The function takes two integer arguments \"x\" and \"y\", and returns a vector of all numbers from \"x\" to \"y\" that are not divisible by 3.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n```\nz(3, 10)\n# Returns: 3 5 7 9\n```\nIn this example, the function returns the numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9, which are the numbers from 3 to 10 that are not divisible by 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."                                                                                                                             
```

### clarifyCode:

This is a basic example which shows you how to Large Language Model clarifies your code.

``` r
clarifyCode("for (i in 1:10) {\n  print(i ** 2)\n}")
[1] "This is a simple for loop in R. It uses the `for` keyword to loop over a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, using the `1:10` syntax to indicate the sequence. For each number in the sequence, the loop runs the code inside the curly braces.\n\nIn this case, the code inside the loop is `print(i ** 2)`. This takes the current value of `i`, squared it using the `**` operator, and then passes it to the `print` function. The result is that each number in the sequence is squared and then printed to the console.\n\nFor example, if the current value of `i` is 3, the code inside the loop would run `print(3 ** 2)`, which would print the value 9 to the console. This process would repeat for each number in the sequence, so the final output would be:\n\n1\n4\n9\n16\n25\n36\n49\n64\n81\n100\n\nThis code is a simple example of how to use a for loop in R to perform a calculation on a sequence of numbers."
```

### debugCode:

This is a basic example which shows you how to find bugs in your code.

``` r
debugCode("z <- function(x) scale(x)2")
[1] "There are a few issues with the code:\n\n1. The variable `z` is not defined. It is not clear what the user expects to be returned by the function, as `z` is not a built-in function in R.\n2. The function `scale` is not defined. It is not clear what the user expects to be returned by the function, as `scale` is not a built-in function in R.\n3. There is a syntax error in the code. The closing parenthesis in the function definition is not balanced.\n4. The function `scale` is not used correctly. It is not clear what the user expects to be returned by the function, as `scale` is not a built-in function in R.\n5. The operator `2` is not defined in R. It is not clear what the user expects to be returned by the function, as `2` is not a built-in function in R.\n\nTo fix these issues, the code should be changed to something like this:\n```\nz <- function(x) {\n  # Calculate the scaled value\n  scaled_x <- x * 2\n  # Return the scaled value\n  return(scaled_"
[2] "To continue, I would suggest taking a close look at the `z` variable and the `scale()` function. It's possible that there is an issue with the way the `scale()` function is being used.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that there is an issue with the data being passed into the function. Maybe the data is not in the correct format or there is an error in the way the data is being passed.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would recommend printing out the data that is being passed into the function and making sure that it is in the correct format. You can also try passing in a simpler data set to see if the function works correctly with that. Finally, I would recommend checking the documentation for the `scale()` function to make sure that you are using it correctly."                                                                                                                                                                                                 
```

### documentCode:

This is a basic example which shows you how to document your code.
Formatting style is `Roxygen2` but can be set to NULL.

``` r
documentCode("z <- function(x) scale(x)^2", inLineDocumentation = NULL)
[1] "`z <- function(x) scale(x)^2`\n\nFunction `z` is a function that takes a single argument `x` and returns the value of `scale(x)^2`.\n\n* `scale()` is a base R function that scales a numeric vector to have a specific range. In this case, the input vector is `x` and the output vector is scaled to have a range of `(0, 1)`.\n* `^2` is the exponentiation operator, which takes the square of the value on its left. In this case, the square of the scaled value of `x` is returned.\n\nSo, the function `z` returns the squared value of `x` after scaling it to have a range of `(0, 1)`."
```

### finishCode:

This is a basic example which shows you how to finish your code by Large Language Model.

``` r
finishCode("# A function to scale a vector and square the resulting z-score z2 <- function(")
 [1] "It looks like you are trying to define a function `z2` that takes a vector as input, scales it, and then squares the resulting z-score. Here is a complete version of the code:\n```\nz2 <- function(x) {\n   x_scaled <- scale(x, center = 0, scale = 1)\n   x_squared <- x_scaled^2\n   x_squared\n}\n```\nThis function takes a vector `x` as input, and performs the following operations:\n\n1. It scales the vector `x` by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, using the `scale` function. This produces a new vector `x_scaled` that has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n2. It squares the elements of the vector `x_scaled`, producing a new vector `x_squared` that contains the squared values of the original vector `x`.\n3. It returns the resulting vector `x_squared`.\n\nYou can use this function just like any other R function, for example:\n```\nx <- rnorm(10)\nz2(x)\n```\nThis would take"

optimizeCode("z <- function(x) scale(x)^2")
[1] "To optimize the R code \"z <- function(x) scale(x)^2\", we can use the `scale` function from the `base` package to scale the input data, and then square it.\n\nHere's an optimized version of the code:\n```R\nz <- function(x) (scale(x)^2)\n```\nThis code uses the `scale` function from the `base` package to scale the input data `x`. The scaled data is then squared using the `^2` operator.\n\nWe can also use the `map` function from the `purrr` package to apply the `z` function to a list of input data. Here's an example:\n```R\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nz_map <- map(list(x1, x2, x3), z)\n```\nThis code applies the `z` function to a list of input data `list(x1, x2, x3)` using the `map` function from the `purrr` package. The resulting list of scaled and squared data is stored in `z_map`.\n\nBoth of these optimizations should significantly improve the performance of the code."

## Perplexity Model Arguments

The parameters of perplexity models can be adjusted by passing
functional arguments.

- `text` or `code`: The text or code input required for processing by
  Large Language Model. If omitted, Large Language Model will utilize the content currently held in the
  clipboard.

- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: The PERPLEXITY API key. By default it is set to
  `Sys.getenv("PERPLEXITY_API_KEY")`.

- `modelSelection`: model choice. Default is `"codellama-34b-instruct"`
  but other available
  [models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/model-cards) are:
  “`llama-2-70b-chat`”, “`mistral-7b-instruct`”,
  “`mixtral-8x7b-instruct`”, “`pplx-7b-chat`”, “`pplx-70b-chat`”,
  “`pplx-7b-online`”, “`pplx-70b-online`”

- `systemRole`: System role for model. Default is set to “You are a
  helpful assistant”.

- `maxTokens`: The maximum integer of completion tokens returned by the
  API. The total number of tokens requested in max_tokens plus the
  number of prompt tokens sent in messages must not exceed the context
  window token limit of model requested. If left unspecified, then the
  model will generate tokens until either it reaches its stop token or
  the end of its context window.

- `temperatur`: The amount of randomness in the response, valued between
  0 inclusive and 2 exclusive. Higher values are more random, and lower
  values are more deterministic. You should either set temperature or
  top_p, but not both.

- `top_p`: The nucleus sampling threshold, valued between 0 and 1
  inclusive. For each subsequent token, the model considers the results
  of the tokens with top_p probability mass. You should either alter
  temperature or top_p, but not both.

- `top_k`: The number of tokens to keep for highest top-k filtering,
  specified as an integer between 0 and 2048 inclusive. If set to 0,
  top-k filtering is disabled.

- `presence_penalty`: A value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values
  penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far,
  increasing the model’s likelihood to talk about new topics.
  Incompatible with frequency_penalty.

- `frequency_penalty`: A multiplicative penalty greater than 0. Values
  greater than 1.0 penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency
  in the text so far, decreasing the model’s likelihood to repeat the
  same line verbatim. A value of 1.0 means no penalty. Incompatible with
  presence_penalty.

- `proxy`: Default value is NULL. To execute Perplexity queries via a
  proxy server, specify the proxy address and port as an argument to the
  function instance. Use the following format:
  `"proxy_address:proxy_port"`. An example would be:
  `"81.94.255.13:8080"`
